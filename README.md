#About:
This is a game where you play pong using a cat. As your score increases, more cats are added to the playing field. What high score can you achieve?

#Prerequisites:
This game is meant to be run a UNIX like platform as the poeng file
is an interpreter file. There is, however, no platform dependent code (except maybe the `fortune` command), which means that a windows user could run the game with the command `python poeng`

Make sure that the pygame package is installed on your machine

#Windows Installation:
If you just want to play the game, go into the downloads folder and download the version that matches your system. Unzip the files into your preferred location. Lastly, just run the poeng(.exe) executable!
